# Hibernate Many to Many

* we can specifying this type of relationships in Hibernate by @ManyToMany annotation .
* we will use example to Summarize the many to many relationship this example shows the many-to-many association between two entities employee and project.
* any given employee can be assigned to multiple projects and a project may have multiple employees working for it, leading to a many-to-many association between the two.
* We need to create the employee and project tables along with the employee_project join table with employee_id and project_id as foreign keys.
* then preparation of the Maven dependencies and Hibernate configuration.
* The Model Classes : Employee and Project need to be created with JPA annotations
* both the Employee class and Project classes refer to one another, which means that the association between them is bidirectional.
* In order to map a many-to-many association, we use the @ManyToMany, @JoinTable and @JoinColumn annotations. 
* The @ManyToMany annotation is used in both classes to create the many-to-many relationship between the entities.
* This association has two sides i.e. the owning side and the inverse side.
* the owning side is Employee so the join table is specified on the owning side by using the @JoinTable annotation in Employee class. 
* The @JoinTable is used to define the join/link table. In this case, it is Employee_Project.
* The @JoinColumn annotation is used to specify the join/linking column with the main table. 

# Security: a humorous overview

* security researchers have a problem with public relations.
