# Java basics :

- Variables : 

    - Instance variables : non static defined to class variables .
    - Class variables : Static variables that have only one copy in the memory .
    - Local variables : variables that is stored in the memory and used in a local scope .
    - Parameters : are the the variables which is declared in the method declaration .

- Naming : Java is case sensitive and follows naming conventions for each variable type .

- Data types : we use int , double , float , byte , short , long for numbers .
- also we use char for characters, boolean for true false values .
- String in java is a class not a data type which is immutable .
- Data types has initial default value .

- Arrays : Arrays in java is an object which holds a fixed number of elements and have a specific type .

- To access array elements we use indexes for that .

- We use System.copyarray to copy from one array to another .

- To manipualte array elements : Several methods are provided in the Arrays.util library to do a lot of tasks .



- Operators : By their precedence :
    - Postfix : ++ --
    - unary : ++ex , --ex
    - multiplicative : * %
    - additive : + -
    - shift : >> << >>
    - relational : > <> <= >=
    - equality : == != 
    - AND : &
    - XOR : ^
    - bitwise inclusive OR	|
    - logical AND : &&
    - logical OR : ||
    - ternary : ? :
    - assignment := += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=

- Arithmetic : are the mathmatical operators which is used in math .
- the assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable .


- Equality and expression operators : 

    - == 
    - !=
    - >=
    - <=
    - <
    - >
    - &&
    - ||
- Instance of method is used to compare between an object and a specific type .


- Expressions, Statements, Blocks :
    - An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value .

    - Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages. A statement forms a complete unit of execution. 

    - A block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed.


- Control Flow Statements :
    - If else statements is more likely the JS one with no difference at all .
    - Controls are the same like in most languages .
    - Loops also have the same syntax as most of other Programming languages .



- **The Java Api is used to document each and every class in the Java language with all it's variables and parameters and methods return type.**


- The computer consists consists of 0's and 1's which is electric transistors of high and low .

- The machine language is trnaslated into higher level languages like Java c# .

- The process of compiling is turning high level language into machine language .
