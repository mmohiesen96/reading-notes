# Functions , Objects : 
    - Functions are a series of instructions that are grouped together and can be recalled anytime.
    - objects : are series of information about a specific element which acts as a real object with attributes and behaviors.
    
    **Functions for example can be declared :**
    function funcName(parameter list){
        code instructions;
    }

    - invoking functions can be done using their names with paranthesses and the parameters if existed.

    - return keyword is used to make the function returns a specific value to the cariable or whatever is using or invoking it.

    - immediatly invoked functions are functions equaled to a variable and held with ().

    -  variable scope : is two types global and local the global variable can work any where through the program , local scope is the variable  that can be used only in the scope it is declared.


    - Objects are modeling of real life elements that have a specefic behavior and special attribute . 

    - Constructor functions are initializing an object using the new keyword , declaring a null object then adding values to it .
    - Creating multiple argument constructer by implementing a function that declares object properties as it's arguments passed to initialize .

    - Accessing objects is done using the literal notation nor the bracket notation approach which is similar to an array but with the key to the property not an index .

    - Deleting an object using the delete keyword .

    - this keyword is used to refer to objects  or to variables within the the object or function scopes .
