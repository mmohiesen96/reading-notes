    then applying a margin to auto .
    - Background image can be given to any element using the background-image property with the url value 
    and by default it will keep repeating to fill the whole element .

- Repeating Images : 
    - background-repeat is used to repeat the image or control the repeating of the image and can take 
    repeat : default value and the image will repeat both verticall and horizontally , repeat x , repeat y to control either vertical or horizontal
    or the property take the no repeat value ,

    - background-attachment : either fixed or scroll to give it a fixed position or scrolls with the page .

- back ground position : given two values from the four sides for example center left and so on ..
