# SQL VS NoSQL 

- SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

- SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores .

- SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

- SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents .

- SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres .

- NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis.

- SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage.

- SQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.

- Example of SQL high complexity data . 

- Example of NoSQL Apache Cassandra . 


## Mongo 

- Mongodb is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents .

- It is non-relational database with dynamic schema. It has been developed by the founders of DoubleClick .

- Written in C++ .

- SQL : stands for structured query languages which is a language used to retrieve and modify database tables.

- realtional databases are tablebased and have alot of restricts to work with .

- The schema is a set of rules that ensures the data to be given following the schema rules .

- In db tables are related to each other .

- Relations have many types like one to one and many to many and many to one for example .

- MongoDB is the most popular NoSQL database .

- Database is in hierarchial structure .
    - we have first the database .
    - then we have collections .
    - inside the collections we have documents .

- nosql doesn't have to follow the same schema .

- They are more flexible than SQL DBs .

- Disadvanteges like duplicate data .

- Usually both of solutions will be implemented in a real project .

- Horiziontal scaling is immpossible and very hard to be done .
