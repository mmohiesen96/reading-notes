# The JavaScript Call Stack

- The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call).
- the call stack is synchronous.
- A call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).
- the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out .
- The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame. 
- A  stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point.


# JavaScript error messages && debugging 

- Types of error messages :

    - Reference errors :
        - This happens when trying to reach variables that are not yet declared . 
        - or hoisting let and const that takes time to hoist .
        - to fix this error declare before initialization .

    - Syntax errors :
        - this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax .

        - Ex : parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.

        - This can be solved by just fixing the syntax . 

    - Range errors :
        - manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length IS THE CAUSE .

        - The best approach and best practice is ti immute your variables and don't mess with the lengths .

    - Type errors
        - his types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible . 

        - To fix this make atesting variable or test if the variable or object exists .


    - Debugging : 
        - To debug your JS code, the easiest and maybe the most common way its to simply console.log() .

        - by using chrome developer tools . 

        - The breakpoint can also be achieved by putting a debugger statement in your code in the line you want to break.

    - Handling errors
        - We use try and catch to handle errors .
        - That will make errors not to break the whole code .
        - The errors will show in a different way .

    - Tools for preventing runtime Errors :
        - quokka to evaluate your code as you type
        - eslint to make sure your style guide is consistency and it will grab you an error or two along the way and
        - For those of you looking to make JS a more strong typed experience you can check out stuff like TypeScript (like I said in a previous article, when learning I rather avoid libraries that abstract the core language so I wouldnâ€™t recommend this last one when starting)
