# How the web works 

- Roy fielding is the one who first wrote the server and helped moving the documents through the web .
- HTTP protocol is one of the most important breakthrough in the world of computing .
- HTTP explains to the browser what protocol to use .
- like a GPS coordinates it can describe the plave of anything on the web .
- The web is built under an architecture of REST which displays resources .
- resources are representation of the data into a web page .
- The URL is the address where you can find this representation .
- Web services and API's are tools can be used by the web like the human uses the web to serve the web needs .
- That means that machines can use these protocols to make requests and access information .
- The web is a big network that gets information and sends it to another machine and so on .
- The GET is an important concept it means that the web will GET the resources and human readable representaions .
- The PUT is used to add something from one system to another system .
- PATCH is used to do a partial update .
