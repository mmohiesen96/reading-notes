Comparison operators :
- == : used to compare two values if equal .
- != : used to compare two values if not equal .
- === (strict equal) : used to compare two values and types ("preferable to use more than ==").
- !== (strict not equal): used to compare two values if not equal in values and types .
- \> : used to identify if the first is greater than the second .
- <  : used to identify if the first is less than the second .
- <= : used to identify if the first is less than or equal the second .
- \>=:used to identify if the first is greater than or equal the second .


* Comparison operators return true or false .

* Logical operators are used to combine the result of two or more comparison statements .

Logical operators : 
- && (and) : Tests more than one condition .
- || (or)  : Tests at least one condition .
- ! (not) : Takes at least on boolean result and inverts it .


Loops : Loop checks a condition if returns true the code block will run then it will check again until that condition operates to false .

Types of loops :
- For loop.
- While loop.
- do While loop.

Loop structure :
the loop name ==> followed with parentheses and in the () "all the contents in the () are seperated by ;"
theres the loop counter followed by curly brackets and the code block to run inside the {} .

Loop counter in details :
- Initialization : Initializes a variable and acts as the counter.
-Condition : The loop runs until this conditin is false .
- Update : the change that happens to the counter each time the code block runs .

While loops : contains the while keyword and the condition followed by the {} and code block and the update statement inside them , but the var initialization can be either in or out of loop in all loops .
