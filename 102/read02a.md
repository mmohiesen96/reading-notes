Markdown :
- Def. : Syntax to style forms of writing on GitHub platform.
- We can use it all around GitHub with Gists , Comments and file with .md or markdown 
extension.
- It's very easy to use ex.: use ** to bold and * for italic use[Url displayed as ](URL)
- Syntax :
- Headers .. We use #'s for it .
- Emphasis .. We use ** or __ for bold text also we use * or _ for italic and both can be combined
- Lists .. We use *ListItem and so on "Unordered List" also 1.List item
"Ordered Lists".
- Images and Links .. For img we use ![Alternative Text](url)
for Links we use [Link text](URL)
- We use > for block quoutes '<>' for inline code .
- GitHub uses it's own flavored markdown , you can indent your code with spaces .
- Task lists are handy progress indicators .
- You can make tables using --------- and | .
- any #No. , @Mention , URL will be converted to a Link.
- words surrounded by ~~ will be crossed out , also GitHub supports Emoji.

- GitHub pages are Live repositories done by you and represented live , working like a 
host , with easy access and live editing to your sites using jekyll.
